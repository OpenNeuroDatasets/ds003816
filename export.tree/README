This dataset contains Pre-rest ; Post-rest; Radiating LKM to Self; Radiating LKM to Other; Visualize Self and Visualize Other (eyes closed) states EEG and ECG recordings with 48 participants. Among of 48 participants, 15 participants were interested to participate as long-term practitioner. They were able to participate EEG and ECG data recording more than 10 times within two-month. For the rest of the participants recorded only once respectively.

High-density EEG and one channel ECG were collected simultaneously by a bio-signal amplifier (actiCHamp, Brain Products, German) from the 48 participants during the whole LKM training session with a sampling frequency of 1000 Hz. 128 EEG electrodes were fixed on the participant’s scalp according to the International 10-20 System. One ECG electrode was fixed on V3 lead. All Electrodes’ impedance was kept under 20kohm to maintain a good signal- to-noise ratio.
